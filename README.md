# spartan-6-DSP48A1-slice
DSP48A1 Spartan-6 FPGA Project â€“ This project implements a high-speed DSP module on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA, leveraging the DSP48A1 slice for efficient multiplication, addition, and accumulation. The Verilog HDL design was functionally verified in QuestaSim and fully implemented in Vivado, where our code directly instantiated the DSP48E1 primitive to ensure optimal hardware mapping. The project includes Verilog sources, QuestaSim testbenches, and FPGA constraint files, with results confirming correct operation and superior performance over LUT-based implementations.
